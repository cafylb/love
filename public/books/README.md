# Books Folder Structure

The album page auto-detects books by folders:

- `book-1`
- `book-2`
- `book-3`

Each book folder must contain page images named in order:

- `1.jpg` / `1.png` / `1.webp` / `1.svg`
- `2.jpg` / ...
- `3.jpg` / ...

Supported extensions: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `webp`, `svg`.

The page at `/album/` loads books and pages automatically based on what exists in this folder.
